# Styled-Components Demo

This is a quick intro on a neat alternative to complex CSS.

## Why?

For a full list of benefits, check out [here](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#motivation). Some things I find most helpful are:

1. Using props to determine styling.
1. Ease of theming
1. Not dealing with combining CSS classes
1. Steamlined inline styles.
1. Styles are more easily refactored
1. Unused styles can be more confidently removed
1. Less inline styling means cleaner code reading

## Get started

1. Clone the repo
1. `npm i`
1. `npm start`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
